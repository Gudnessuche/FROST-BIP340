EXTREMELY DANGEROUS AND RECKLESS TO USE THIS MODULE IN PRODUCTION!

This package provides cryptographic functionalities for implementing the FROST
signature scheme.

Modules:
- point: Defines the Point class for handling points on an elliptic curve.
- participant: Contains the Participant class for managing participants in the
  FROST scheme.
- aggregator: Implements the Aggregator class to coordinate the aggregation of
  cryptographic elements.
- constants: Holds cryptographic constants like P, Q, and G, crucial for
  elliptic curve operations.

The package supports operations such as point arithmetic, nonce generation,
share aggregation, and signature generation, all within the context of
threshold cryptography.
